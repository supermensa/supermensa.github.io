# _“Deconstructing to rediscover”_

> I specialize myself in understanding your business workflow to build digital experiences around it

## Approach
### What I prefer to be doing on sunday is the same on monday

**Wouldn't it be great if using software was like playing with a toy?**. It is a question that has come up at the start of every project I have ever worked on: _"Couldn't we make this easier and more fun to work with?"_.  

The problem is usually that bad habits are hard to change - and they are tied directly to the digital aspects of even the simplest work routines.   

**If we strive to see software** as powerful tools that allows us to get better work done everytime we commit ourselves — and finding it easier to collaborate seamlessly across platforms. Software like that. Can this really be hard?

**The reality is** that most companies are still working in the slipstream of past trends and the bad habits are getting in the way of the future.

What would make me happy is to redefine what - and who - software are made for – by rethinking interfaces as both complicated configurations to what is unique to your work process, we should also treat it with the simplicity of using a hammer. I believe it is possible to enter such a magical space, where great work can happen and tools do start to adapt to _how we are working_.

**To observe and prototype**

I believe in experiences. While software is something transient that is always evolving, strong ideas can last forever.

The fastest way to communicate any message to an audience, is by finding the narrative that give users an experience with impact.

A key issue is to build small things, prototype and test the minimal viable product. To actually get things started and build it so it works, get it off the ground and investigate while you are in the air.  

This is how you see more of the terrain.

I've had the pleasure of working with talented people and companies. From small teams - to large organizations. Everyone of them having unique talents and problems. The important thing is to keep learning. 

## Studies
### I read manuals and drink coffee, then I do what I just read (and sometimes a bit more than that)
  
I've studied Object Oriented Programming at the IT University of Copenhagen (ITU), taken courses in Scrum (Agile software development) and Information Architecture.

## Technology
### Don't think of technology as anything other than a large amount of hammers and pliers that are to be forever perfected

I've used Python, Node.js, JavaScript, HTML5 APIs, CSS compilers, Linux distros, Vagrant, Nginx etc.  

My approach to technology is this; work with whatever fits the purpose. I get my knowledge from manuals as the wisdom from friends & collaborators.


## Profession
### What are you again?

I think _designer_ fits the description of what I do.

I've worked as a _digital designer_, _webdeveloper_, _project manager_, _product designer_, _graphic designer_, _art director_, _photographer_.

A designer simply a connects things, so that they work — and look good.

## Hobbies
### On the way to work

Purely creative work keeps me on the edge. I often take on projects that are challenging to produce or that provoke new things to unravel.
