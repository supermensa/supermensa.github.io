> "So the idea of work, doing work that one would find to be stultifying or a waste of your time, was the worst thing that could happen to you as a human being, because nothing on Earth is more important than time and what you do with your time. And if you give up one third of your life or more to a task that you find stultifying or not up to your potential, you're really wasting your life."
